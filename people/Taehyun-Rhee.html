    <p>Taehyun Rhee is a senior lecturer of School of Engineering and Computer Science. He received his PhD in Computer Science from University of Southern California in USA. Before joining Victoria, he was a project leader and senior researcher of 3D Mixed Reality Group at Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT) in South Korea from 2008 to 2012. Also, he was a senior engineer of Research Innovation Center at Samsung Electronics from 1996 to 2003.</p>
    
    <p>Taehyun Rhee’s research concern is to solve scientific problems related to Computer Graphics, Computer Animation, Computer Vision, Medical Imaging. His current research activity is focused on realistic human body modeling and animation, soft-tissue deformation, surface/volume reconstruction from scans, and real-time global illumination.</p>

    <h2 id="human-body-modeling-and-animation">Human body modeling and animation</h2>
    
    <p>Real-time facial animation from live video tracking; a complete pipe-line for producing real-time facial expressions of a 3D virtual avatar controlled by an actor’s live performances captured by a web cam. </p>
    
    <p>Real-time human body animation using sensors; performance animation that employs a small number of motion sensors to create an easy-to-use system for an interactive control of a full-body human character (collaboration with Texas A&amp;M University in USA). </p>
    
    <p>Scan-based medical volume animation; a complete system to create anatomically accurate example-based volume deformation and animation of articulated body regions, starting from multiple in vivo volume scans of a specific individual. </p>
    
    <p>Real-time skin deformation on the GPU; parallel skin deformation methods using GPU fragment processors.</p>

    <p>Human hand modeling from surface anatomy; creating a person-specific 3D hand model from a single canonically posed palm image of the hand without human guidance.</p>
    
    <p>Medical volume registration; a locally adaptive non-rigid volume registration algorithm that efficiently reduces computation cost while avoiding the strong local minima inherent in articulated body registration.</p>
